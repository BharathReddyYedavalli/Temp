    "**Tell me what you saw in the outputs above, and I'll help you understand what it means!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Look For:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. From Cell 2 (Directory Listing):**\n",
    "- Did you see `.pth` files in each model folder?\n",
    "- Any other files like `.json`, `.txt`, or `.log`?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. From Cell 3 (Model Metadata):**\n",
    "- Did it show \"Checkpoint keys: [...]\"?\n",
    "- Any mention of `class_to_idx` or `classes`?\n",
    "- Or just \"Direct state_dict (no metadata)\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. From Cell 6 (Quick Model Test):**\n",
    "- What were the \"Class 0 probability\" and \"Class 1 probability\" values?\n",
    "- Which class did it predict (0 or 1)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. From Cell 10-11 (Comprehensive Analysis):**\n",
    "- How many times did each model predict Class 0 vs Class 1?\n",
    "- What were the average probabilities?\n",
    "- Did you see any \"🔴 PROBLEM\" or \"⚠️ BIAS\" warnings?\n",

    "*This means the model almost always predicts the same class - it's broken!*\n",

    "**Pattern B: Balanced (GOOD)**\n",

    "Class 0 predictions: 4/10\n",
    "Class 1 predictions: 6/10\n",
    "✅ Model appears balanced\n",

    "*This means the model can distinguish between classes properly.*\n",
